While I did not run each and very program, I ran most including at least 
one pertaining to each of the following topics.

Book One:

Ran class Hello World program.
Used Eclipse IDE which I'm familiar with.

Book Two:

* Used object instance - Ran another version of Hello World that uses a Greeter class.
* static variables (class scoped)
* Scanner objects (reading input)
* Math class, math operators
* Loops: while, do/while, for
* Switch statment.
* Methods
* Exceptions - InputMismatchException 

Book 3:
I did not spend enough time to master the abstract, interface and inner class concepts.

* Found basic template link in 2. to be broken.
* Implemented Player class with get and set methods on health.

Book 4:
* Examined multi-dimensional arrays in KnightMoves example which 
  will probably be useful for the magic square homework problem.

Book 5:

* Implemented regex example
